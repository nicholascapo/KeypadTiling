# Keypad Tiling

Tile windows with your keypad.

## Features :

* Tile focused window with `Super` + `divide`/`0`/`1`/.../`9` keypad keys
* Get window completion popup with `Super` + `Alt` + `1`/.../`9` keypad keys
* Customize keybindings in preferences

## Install :

1. Download and decompress or clone the repository
2. Place the resulting directory in `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`
3. IMPORTANT: change the directory name to `keypadTiling@abakkk.framagit.org`
4. A small shot of `Alt + F2` `r` to restart gnome-shell under Xorg, restart or relogin under Wayland
5. Enable the extension in gnome-tweaks
6. `Super + keypad key` or `Super + Alt + keypad key` to test
7. [https://framagit.org/abakkk/KeypadTiling/issues](https://framagit.org/abakkk/KeypadTiling/issues) to say it doesn't work

## Details :

* Tiling is not exactly the same as the one that GNOME Shell provides. For instance left and right tiling are more basic while corner tiling gains resizing.
* Default `Super + keypad key` keybindings could conflict with those of other extensions like popular *Dash to Dock* and *Dash to Panel* (see either *Keypad Tiling* or *other extension* preferences).
